		Enter the filepaths of the files to exclude from the upload for scanning, represented as a comma-separated
		list of	ant-style exclude patterns relative to the job's workspace root directory.
	</p>
	<p>
		Patterns are case-sensitive. Patterns that include commas because they denote filepaths that contain commas need to have the commas replaced with a wildcard character.
	</p>
	<p>
		No files (except default excludes) in the job's workspace root directory are excluded when omitted.
