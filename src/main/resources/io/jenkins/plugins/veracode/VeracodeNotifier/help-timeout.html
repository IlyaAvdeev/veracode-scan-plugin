	<p>If you want to view the results of the Veracode scan in Jenkins, you must select this checkbox. This action prompts the Jenkins project to wait the provided amount of time or until the scan completes.</p>
	<p>If the scan does not complete and pass policy compliance within the allotted time and the Fail Job option in your Veracode Jenkins Plugin settings is enabled, the build will fail.</p>
	<p>If you select this checkbox with the Fail Build option disabled, the scan failure will appear in the log but it will not cause the build to fail.</p>
