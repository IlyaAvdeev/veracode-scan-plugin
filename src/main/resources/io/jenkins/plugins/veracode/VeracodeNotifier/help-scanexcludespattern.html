<div class="veracode" id="scanexcludespattern-help-id-static-freestyle">
	<p>
		Enter the filenames of the uploaded files not to scan as top level modules, represented as a comma-separated
		list of	ant-style-like exclude patterns such that '*' matches 0 or more characters and '?' matches exactly 1 character.
	</p>
	<p>
		Patterns are case-sensitive. Patterns that include commas because they denote filenames that contain commas need to have the commas replaced with a wildcard character.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because the matching is performed based only on filename, it is incorrect to use patterns that include path separators ('\' or '/').
	</p>
	<p>
		No uploaded files are excluded when omitted.
