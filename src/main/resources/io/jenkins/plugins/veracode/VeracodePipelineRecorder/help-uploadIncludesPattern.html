		Enter the filepaths of the files to upload for scanning, represented as a comma-separated
		list of	ant-style include patterns relative to the job's workspace root directory.

		Patterns are case-sensitive. Patterns that include commas because they denote filepaths that contain commas need to replace the commas with a wildcard character.

		If no filepaths are provided, all files in the job's workspace root directory are included.
