		Enter the filename pattern that represents the names of the uploaded files that should be saved with a different name.
		The '*' wildcard matches 0 or more characters. The '?' wildcard matches exactly 1 character.
		Each wildcard corresponds to a numbered group that can be referenced in the replacement pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pattern is case-sensitive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because the matching is performed based only on filename, it is incorrect to use patterns that include path separators ('\' or '/').
	</p>
	<p>
		No uploaded files are saved with a different name when either the filename pattern or the replacement pattern is omitted.
